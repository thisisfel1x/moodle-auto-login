4) Choose your file and press "open"
5) Restart Firefox if necessary

## Features

You have the possibility to activate or deactivate this addon. 
If it is activated, you will automatically be logged in, after that all your courses will open in a new tab and close immediately after the finished loading.

### ⚠️ Attention
Make sure Firefox already knows your Login. If not, login manually and click on ```Save Login Data``` on a popup in the top left-hand corner.
> Make sure to deactivate the addon to prevent a failed login everytime you visit the login page
